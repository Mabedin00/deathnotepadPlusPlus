bugs:
- fix darts moving when paused
    - darts must store their target
    - iterate through darts when paused, setVelocity(0, 0)
    - iterate through darts when unpausing, restart setMove();
- darts don't disappear at range
    - darts are passed their range by target
    - every tick they check if the distance between their start and their current position exceeds range
        - if it does, self-destruct
- button outline gone
    - ???
- MOAB does not rotate
    - caluclates this.rotation based on angle between their current point in interpolation of points
- invincibility bug
    - ??? doesn't exist. Really, I don't know what you're talking about. Never seen it.
- work out all depths

optomizations:
- precalculate interpolation

- (potentially) graphics final project
